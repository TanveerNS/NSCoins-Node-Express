### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Deploy to Heroku
Heroku

Heroku is a free hosting service for hosting small projects. Easy setup and deploy from the command line via git.

Pros
Easy setup
Free
Cons
App has to sleep a couple of hours every day.
"Powers down" after 30 mins of inactivity. Starts back up when you visit the site but it takes a few extra seconds. Can maybe be solved with Kaffeine
Install Heroku
1 . Create an account on https://heroku.com. This should be pretty straight forward. 2 . Install the Heroku CLI on your computer:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli. Check that you have the heroku-cli installed by checking the version number in your terminal:

heroku --version
3 . Connect the Heroku CLI to your account by writing the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions on the command line:

heroku login
Use your credentials from the earlier account creation.
